The Terminus Systems are infested with batarian pirate gangs and slaving rings, fueling the stereotype of the batarian thug. It should be noted that these criminals do not represent average citizens, who are forbidden to leave batarian space by their ubiquitous and paranoid government.</p>\n<h3><strong>Caste Through Credits</strong></h3>\n<p>Batarians place an extremely high value on social caste and appearance, and overstepping one's place is frowned upon. Effective caste status can be bought on an ongoing basis like a subscription service, allowing the buyer to worm their way into the elite circles of batarian society given enough funds. Casting aspersions on the monetary worth of a social better is considered a serious insult. Batarians strongly believe that species with fewer than four eyes are less intelligent; they often gain the upper hand in interspecies arguments because other species find it difficult to know which eyes to focus on when speaking to them.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Hegemony</strong></h3>\n<p>Their government, known as the Batarian Hegemony, is hostile to the Systems Alliance (human government), but beneath the notice of the powerful Council species. Humans receive the brunt of batarians' antagonism in the form of scams, slave raids, and terrorist attacks, incidents which the Hegemony covertly supports but is always quick to publicly distance itself from. Given the batarian government's oppressive nature, it is speculated their supreme leadership is autocratic or totalitarian in nature, although the batarian homeworld of Khar'shan remains divided into various competing nation-states.</p>\n<h3><strong>Batarian Names</strong></h3>\n<p>Like humans, batarian names consist of a given name and family name.</p>\n<p>Male Names: Afothor, Carn, Dhapo, Drathar, Ecray, Eporn, Irorok, Khamak, Okorem, Prathan, Sato, Sonk, Uderlak</p>\n<p>Female Names: Apenine, Adrechia, Banim, Della, Erakis, Famisa, Fophe, Igosin, Iraphi, Kranine, Krathe, Okhefin, Pravile, Ramye</p>\n<p>Family Names: Can'dabar, Das'codah, Dhen'gess, Dran'fapos, Ghapsacan, Gronnopos, Kasbovran, Khognalak, Krak'gork, Pec'bawen, Sanrowar</p>\n<h2><strong>Traits</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></p>\n<p>+1 to all ability scores</p>\n<p><strong>Age</strong></p>\n<p>Batarians age at about the same rate as humans, though many do not live past 100 due to their caustic and dangerous lifestyles.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong></p>\n<p>Because of the tenets of Hegemony, batarians tend to be lawful evil, although there are outliers on the moral spectrum.</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong></p>\n<p>Batarian bodies are similar to humans, with the exception of a large forehead to accommodate their additional four eyes, making them about 15cm (6\") taller.

They are the only known extant sapient species native to the Heleus Cluster of the Andromeda galaxy, and arose on the planet Havarl. Their unique physiology is dependant on sunlight and allows them to produce natural bioelectrical fields. The angara as a people are very free with their emotions, demonstrative and \"larger than life\". If they love you they hug you, if they hate you or if you make them mad, they punch you.</p>\n<h3><strong>Creatures of the Sun</strong></h3>\n<p>The angara are dependant on electromagnetic radiation that is emitted from a sun to survive. Lack of real or artificial sunlight causes them to \"go dark\", which weakens their immune systems and bio-energy significantly. Prolonged lack of sunlight can lead to a coma and then death. To supplement their sunlight intake when natural light is not readily available, the angara make use of powerful ultraviolet lamps that give them both heat and light.</p>\n<h3><strong>Family Oriented</strong></h3>\n<p>While they have only one true mother and father, the angara share their parents with the community. Their families are very large, consisting of multiple mothers and many siblings and cousins. This close-knit society makes angara very mistrustful of other species.</p>\n<p>While the angara have many different religions, all share the same basic tenet: that when an angara dies, he or she is reincarnated and the reincarnated soul stays in the family, making their lineage stronger.</p>\n<h3><strong>Angara Names</strong></h3>\n<p>Little is known about angaran names.
